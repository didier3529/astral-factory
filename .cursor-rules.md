IMPORTANT WORKING RULES FOR CURSOR AI:

When working with my code, adhere strictly to these rules:

1. CORE FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION: Never modify, remove, or replace any code that relates to core functionality. This includes:
   - Event handlers and listeners
   - API calls and data processing
   - State management logic
   - User interaction flows
   - Component lifecycle methods
   - Context providers and consumers

2. STYLING CHANGES ONLY: Only make changes to:
   - CSS/SCSS files
   - Style properties within components
   - className assignments
   - Style-related props
   - Theme configuration

3. CONFLICT RESOLUTION: If you encounter a situation where styling changes would break functionality:
   - DO NOT make the change
   - Notify me of the conflict
   - Suggest alternative approaches that would preserve functionality
   - Await my decision before proceeding

4. VERIFICATION PROCEDURE: After each styling change:
   - Run the application to verify it still functions correctly
   - Test all user interactions affected by the styling change
   - Revert immediately if any functionality is compromised

5. DOCUMENTATION: For each styling change, document:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - Any potential issues to be aware of

These rules are non-negotiable. When in doubt, prioritize maintaining functionality over aesthetic improvements.
Run the app every single time you make any changes to verify if they're working properly. Don't just make multiple code changes without testing between them.
